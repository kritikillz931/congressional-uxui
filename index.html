    <!--Representative Background Info-->
    <section class="back_info">
        <h4>Blackburn is the senior senator from Tennessee and is a Republican. She has served since Jan 3, 2019.
            Blackburn is next up for reelection in 2024 and serves until Jan 3, 2025.
            She was previously the representative for Tennessee’s 7th congressional district as a Republican from 2003
            to 2018.
            Blackburn is among the Republican legislators who, by calling for entire states to be disenfranchised in the
            2020 presidential election, fomented the terrorist attack on the Capitol on January 6, 2021 that aimed to
            prevent the determination of the next president of the United States. In the days leading up to January 6,
            Blackburn had announced her intent to object on that day to the inclusion of some states in the count of
            electors that determines the next president, disenfranchising millions of voters based on lies, conspiracy
            theories, and preposterous legal theories all falsely claiming various sorts of mass fraud that did not
            occur. The announcement amplified the message that inspired the attack on the Capitol.</h4>
